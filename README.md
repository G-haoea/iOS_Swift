This is a story contains the process of learning ios development. 
I noted some points which I met during this process in **Wiki**. 
Maybe the basic principles and any bugs can be regarded as simple ones in the future, but it truely impresses me right now. 

After I learnt some tips about Swift or the methods of using Xcode, maybe the grammar for designing interface on ios as well, I recognise the basic important thing for a programmar is **getting foundation of Internet clearly**.   

### The following is the every step to explore ios development by Xcode.
